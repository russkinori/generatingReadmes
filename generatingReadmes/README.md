## Description

This repo contains an interactive command-line application that prompts a user for information about an application repository and uses the input to generate a high-quality, professional README.md. Technologies used for the creation of this application include inquirer using npm, package.json, fs module, Node.js, and JavaScript. 

## Issues

Pasting information into the application was initially difficult. Further investigation revealed that because the **enter (return) key** completed the entry, the application recognised it's use within the pasted information. In those instances, other sections or the README were unintentionally populated. Therefore, ``` **_<br>_**``` was used to separate all information that needed to be on a new line.
